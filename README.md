# Social-Network-API-Using-NoSQL

## Description 

This application is an API that could be used for a social media web application. This API uses a MongoDB database, Express.js, and Monogoose ODM. It allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This NoSQL database would allow the website to handle large amounts of unstructured data. This application is not deployed, please see walkthrough videos for further details.
